# hello-world

Hello,


I'm Joshua Rogers, a student at the University of Nevada-Reno.
I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering.

I decided to pursue a career in technology while working in my previous
career as a metallurgical process engineer at a gold mining company.
I had the opportunity to be exposed to the integration of technology
for process control, process monitoring, and data analytics while working
in that position. I decided that I rather enjoyed working with technology
particularly trying to find new implementations and engineer better
technological solutions.

I feel that Computer Science and Engineering will give me ample
opportunities to design and implement solutions, which is my true
passion in engineering. I strive to drive progress and become a
catalyst for change.
